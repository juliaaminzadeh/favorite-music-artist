          <p>
            Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi, is an American rapper,
            singer, songwriter, producer, actor, and record executive. Cudi's
            debut single was "Day 'n' Night" and this song is what kick-started
            his career.

            "I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away cause they gone judge me
            anyway, so whatever."

          <p>
            This is my favorite lyric because it is quite inspirational. What
            Kid Cudi means is that you might as well do whatever you want,
            people will judge, and you only have one life to live it up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kid Cudi has very powerful messages within his songs. He wants
            people to realize that success does not determine your worth and
            that you cannot let others judgement affect what you do. He also
            talks about a lot of hardships in his life which makes him a much
            more relatable artist comparatively to others.
